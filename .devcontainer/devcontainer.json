{Monitoring the usage of your GitHub tokens is an essential part of maintaining security. Hereâ€™s how you can keep track of where and how your tokens are being used:
1. Enable GitHub Security Features:
    * GitHub provides built-in security features that allow you to review the usage of your personal access tokens. Make sure these features are enabled by checking your GitHub account security settings.
2. Review Token Access Logs:
    * GitHub provides a security log where you can view activities related to your account, including token usage.
    * To access the security log:
        * Click on your profile picture in the upper right corner and select Settings.
        * In the left sidebar, click on Security log.
        * Look for entries related to token usage, such as API access and authentication events.
3. Use GitHub Audit Logs (for Organizations):
    * If you are an organization owner, you can gain insights into token usage through audit logs, which provide detailed information about access and activities.
    * To access audit logs:
        * Go to your organization's main page.
        *         * Click on Settings.
        * Select Audit log from the left sidebar.
        * Filter logs to find events related to personal access tokens.
4. Implement API Rate Limiting:
    * If you have a self-hosted service interacting with GitHub, implement rate limiting to monitor and control the number of API requests made using the token.
    * Look for anomalies in API request rates, which can indicate misuse or unauthorized access.
5. Integrate with Monitoring Tools:
    * Use monitoring tools like Datadog, Splunk, or AWS CloudWatch to track token usage by logging API requests or webhook events.
    * Set up alerts for unusual activities, such as spikes in API usage.
6. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
    * Though not directly related to token monitoring, enabling 2FA adds an additional layer of security that helps protect your account and makes it harder for malicious actors to misuse tokens.
7. Regularly Review and Rotate Tokens:
    * Regularly review your active tokens and ensure they are still needed.
    * Rotate tokens periodically to limit the potential impact of a compromised token.

By following these steps, you can effectively monitor the usage of your GitHub tokens and ensure the security of your account and data.
